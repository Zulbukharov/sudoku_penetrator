## Empty
> The ultimate in ‘not enough input’, this puzzle contains no givens at all. To 
> say that it has multiple solutions is something of an overstatement. 


##  Single Given 
> Originally described as ‘Zen Sudoku’, rumor has it that the only way to solve
> this puzzle is to stare at the lone ‘1’ in the center of the grid. Expected 
> results could include “not enough starting values” or “multiple solutions”. 


##  Insufficient Givens 
> This puzzle has only sixteen givens, which is one less than the accepted minimum 
> number for a classic Sudoku puzzle. Expected results could include “not enough 
> starting values” or “multiple solutions”. 



##  Duplicate Given — Box 
> This puzzle cannot be solved, because the middle box (b5) has the value ‘5’
> twice. 

##  Duplicate Given — Column 
> This puzzle cannot be solved, because the middle column (c5) has the value ‘1’ 
> twice. 


##  Duplicate Given — Row 
> This puzzle cannot be solved, because the middle row (r5) has the value ‘2’ 
> twice.
